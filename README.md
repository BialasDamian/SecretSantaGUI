# SecretSantaGUI
This Python script employs Tkinter for a "Secret Santa" game GUI. It allows inputting, shuffling, and assigning gift recipients, along with participant instructions. The program checks for duplicates, updates the list, and offers draw and reset buttons. When "Draw" is pressed, it shuffles names, assigns recipients, and displays messages.
